## On the day

The ceremony will take place at *1.30* pm at [Vinice Svaté Kláry]((https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/''/Art+Restaurant+Manes,+Masarykovo+n%C3%A1b%C5%99.+250%2F1,+110+00+Nov%C3%A9+M%C4%9Bsto,+Czechia/@50.0774783,14.3440801,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x470b94f0d8a42af1:0x4a8eaf7412837170!2m2!1d14.4141197!2d50.0774994)) in the district of Troja (~~a name, a plan~~).

The vineyard is a part of the Prague Botanical Garden.

As the area gets fairly busy during weekends, the most convenient means of transport is to take bus 112 from Nádraží Holešovice up to the stop Kovárna which is located a couple of meters away from the lower entrance to the garden (under the vineyard).

At the gate, there will be someone to greet you and give you further directions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should you arrive by car, please let us know in advance. The parking options are very limited.

After the ceremony, there will be little refreshments including local wine. At *3.30pm* we will move to [Mánes Art Restaurant](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/''/Art+Restaurant+Manes,+Masarykovo+n%C3%A1b%C5%99.+250%2F1,+110+00+Nov%C3%A9+M%C4%9Bsto,+Czechia/@50.0774783,14.3440801,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x470b94f0d8a42af1:0x4a8eaf7412837170!2m2!1d14.4141197!2d50.0774994) for the reception which will start at *4pm*.

The restaurant is in the very centre of Prague which makes it very difficult for parking.

There will be a coach that will bring you from the vineyard to the restaurant.

There is *no specific dresscode*.

If we are lucky, the *temperature will be around 20C*.

The ceremony will be outdoors so please bring umbrellas in [case of rain](https://darksky.net/forecast/50.1175,14.4234/ca12/en).

The ceremony will be on the top of the vineyard so keep that in mind when choosing footware (there is a paved path).


## In, out and about Prague

There are multiple options how to get to Prague.

* For those coming by plane, the most convenient is flying to Vaclav Havel airport.
  The airport is well connected with the city centre by public transport.
  There is a bus stop in front of both terminals (Terminal 1 for those coming from outside the Schengen area and Terminal 2 for those traveling within Schengen area).
  Line *119* brings you to the tram and metro in about 15 mins.
  **Don’t forget to buy tickets – there are vending machines within both terminals and also Prague public transport counters.**

* If you are coming by train, you will most likely arrive to the Main train station.
  It’s straight at the metro and there is a tram stop nearby.
  The park surrounding the train station is quite infamous for its inhabitants so watch out and don’t walk through the park in the night if not necessary.

* If you are coming by car, make sure your hotel provide parking spaces.
  In most parts of Prague parking is only for residents and the options for non-residents are very limited.
  You will also *need a vignette for the motorway*.

If you are planning to move around the city using public transport (highly reccomended option), consider buying a three-day ticket.

You can buy them in tobacco shops or at vending machines at all metro stations and most tram stops.

**Don’t forget to stamp your ticket using it for the first time.**


## Accomodation

Prague is full of hotels, hostels and b’n’bs that fit any budget.

The public transport in the city works very well and therefore almost any part of Prague would be fine.

We would, however, recommend you to look for accommodation in the 7th or 6th district, particularly in the areas of Letná, Bubeneč, Dejvice as:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* they are all well situated close to the city centre as well as the ceremony and reception venues.
* prices should be more reasonable than in the very centre of Prague.


Some hotels in the area are for example:

* [Hotel Belvedere](https://www.hotelbelvedereprague.cz/en/)
* [Parkhotel Praha](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g274707-d276653-Reviews-Parkhotel_Praha-Prague_Bohemia.html)


There are plenty of apartments available for short rent through Airbnb, Booking.com and other sites.

**Do not hesitate to ask should you need any assistance with choosing or booking your accommodation.**
